Since we already have Chocolatey installed, the 3 commands we need here are:
1. `choco install ruby -y`
2. `gem install bundler`
3. `gem install jekyll`

I was also following the video from YouTube:
[Jekyll Tutorial][jekyllyoutube]

And built from a base template from git.
Here are some other site sources as well:
